    <section class="brief-introduction">
        <p>I'll add to this later, but I do want to write a detailed introduction that speaks about Miyamoto
            Musashi.
            This will give me the opportunity to practice my HTML and CSS skills. Later, I intend on adding
            Javascript by replacing
            DOM elements.

                Miyamoto Musashi, a legendary samurai from feudal Japan, stands out as one of the most formidable and
                revered warriors in history.
                His mastery of swordsmanship, honed through relentless practice and battlefield experience, earned him a
                reputation that transcends time.
                Musashi’s skill was not just in his physical prowess but in his strategic mind. He is best known for his
                undefeated record in numerous duels,
                including his famous encounter with the famed swordsman Sasaki Kojiro. This duel, where Musashi emerged
                victorious using an unorthodox technique,
                cemented his status as a martial arts icon.
